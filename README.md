### Introduction
Innovation Cloud want to create a Rails app to collect email signups. At the bottom of the page, when a user enters their email, the email is saved into the database.
Using the request/response cycle as a guide, hereâ€™s what we need to do for the Innovation Cloud app:

- In the first turn of the request/response cycle, the signup form is displayed to the user.

- When the user fills in the form with an email and submits it, it triggers the second turn of the request/response cycle, where the email data is saved into the database.
